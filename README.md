# Edge Computing Benefits in Low-Latency IoT Applications: A Comprehensive Survey

**A project for the Wireless Networks for Mobile Applications course - MSc Computer Science - University of Padova.**

The survey explores the role of edge computing in addressing challenges associated with traditional cloud-based IoT architectures, such as high latency, bandwidth constraints, and scalability limitations. By shifting computational resources closer to IoT devices, edge computing reduces dependency on centralized cloud infrastructure, enabling faster processing, improved reliability, and enhanced security. A special focus is given to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), highlighting strategies for computation offloading and energy efficiency. The survey also includes case studies, demonstrating the applications of edge computing in mobile gaming and industrial manufacturing. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges of system integration, resource management, and security while offering insights into future developments in the field.
